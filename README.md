# Graphics engine project


This project is a basic graphics engine able to render environments with the following different techniques:

- Textured surfaces
- Mirrored surfaces
- Hard and soft shading
- Adjustable light source
- Adjustable camera angle and lens
- phong and geraud shading for curved surfaces

The engine takes in and parses a vector coordinate file to render.
